# KeyboardCAD
A tool for creating FreeCAD files for custom keyboards

KeyboardCAD is a python script that uses the raw data generated by http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ to design a switch mounting plate for any keyboard imaginable. 

Thanks to Ian Prest for http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ and to Juergen Riegel, Werner Mayer, Yorik van Havre and everyone else involved with FreeCAD.

FreeCAD 0.14 is the only requirement.
